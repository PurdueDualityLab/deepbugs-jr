\section{Introduction}

In this project, we will perform a replication study of \textit{DeepBugs: A Learning Approach to Name-based Bug Detection} \cite{pradel_deepbugs_2018}. We select this paper because (1) our team is interested in automated bug detection methods, and (2) the paper is particularly novel when compared to other automated bug detectors. Instead of using hand-crafted heuristics to judge where source code contains bugs, the DeepBugs framework fully automates the detection of name-based bugs via deep learning. Moreover, since the paper first appeared in a 2018 OOPSLA issue of \textit{The Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages}, it has gained considerable popularity. According to the ACM, 40 other peer-reviewed works cite the paper, while Google Scholar registers the total citation count at 99.

In our replication study, we will implement the algorithms outlined in the DeepBugs paper and test them using the original authors' data sets to see if we can reproduce the same results.
