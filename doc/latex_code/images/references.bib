	abstract = {Identifier names are often used by developers to convey additional information about the meaning of a program over and above the semantics of the programming language itself. We present an algorithm that uses this information to detect argument selection defects, in which the programmer has chosen the wrong argument to a method call in Java programs. We evaluate our algorithm at Google on 200 million lines of internal code and 10 million lines of predominantly open-source external code and find defects even in large, mature projects such as OpenJDK, ASM, and the MySQL JDBC. The precision and recall of the algorithm vary depending on a sensitivity threshold. Higher thresholds increase precision, giving a true positive rate of 85\%, reporting 459 true positives and 78 false positives. Lower thresholds increase recall but lower the true positive rate, reporting 2,060 true positives and 1,207 false positives. We show that this is an order of magnitude improvement on previous approaches. By analyzing the defects found, we are able to quantify best practice advice for API design and show that the probability of an argument selection defect increases markedly when methods have more than five arguments.},

	abstract = {Natural language elements in source code, e.g., the names of variables and functions, convey useful information. However, most existing bug detection tools ignore this information and therefore miss some classes of bugs. The few existing name-based bug detection approaches reason about names on a syntactic level and rely on manually designed and tuned algorithms to detect bugs. This paper presents DeepBugs, a learning approach to name-based bug detection, which reasons about names based on a semantic representation and which automatically learns bug detectors instead of manually writing them. We formulate bug detection as a binary classification problem and train a classifier that distinguishes correct from incorrect code. To address the challenge that effectively learning a bug detector requires examples of both correct and incorrect code, we create likely incorrect code examples from an existing corpus of code through simple code transformations. A novel insight learned from our work is that learning from artificially seeded bugs yields bug detectors that are effective at finding bugs in real-world code. We implement our idea into a framework for learning-based and name-based bug detection. Three bug detectors built on top of the framework detect accidentally swapped function arguments, incorrect binary operators, and incorrect operands in binary operations. Applying the approach to a corpus of 150,000 JavaScript files yields bug detectors that have a high accuracy (between 89\% and 95\%), are very efficient (less than 20 milliseconds per analyzed file), and reveal 102 programming mistakes (with 68\% true positive rate) in real-world code.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can fool classifiers by maliciously adding imperceptible perturbations to the original input. Currently, a large number of research on defending adversarial examples pay little attention to the real-world applications, either with high computational complexity or poor defensive effects. Motivated by this observation, we develop an efficient preprocessing module to defend adversarial attacks. Specifically, before an adversarial example is fed into the model, we perform two low-level image transformations, WebP compression and flip operation, on the picture. Then we can get a de-perturbed sample that can be correctly classified by DNNs. WebP compression is utilized to remove the small adversarial noises. Due to the introduction of loop filtering, there will be no square effect like JPEG compression, so the visual quality of the denoised image is higher. And flip operation, which flips the image once along one side of the image, destroys the specific structure of adversarial perturbations. By taking class activation mapping to localize the discriminative image regions, we show that flipping image may mitigate adversarial effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods. It can effectively defend adversarial attacks while ensuring only slight accuracy drops on normal images.},

	abstract = {Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-network and searching for an optimal architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely, Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-network to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We alleviate it using edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoys both faster speed and higher training stability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57\% on CIFAR10 with merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2\% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) using 3.8 GPU-days for search.

In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},

We propose AutoNL to overcome the above two obstacles. Firstly, we propose a Lightweight Non-Local (LightNL) block by squeezing the transformation operations and incorporating compact features.

	abstract = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an important yet challenging task in network design due to its high computational consumption. To address this issue, we propose the Reinforced Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (RENAS), which is an evolutionary method with reinforced mutation for NAS. Our method integrates reinforced mutation into an evolution algorithm for neural architecture exploration, in which a mutation controller is introduced to learn the effects of slight modifications and make mutation actions. The reinforced mutation controller guides the model population to evolve efficiently. Furthermore, as child models can inherit parameters from their parents during evolution, our method requires very limited computational resources. In experiments, we conduct the proposed search method on CIFAR-10 and obtain a powerful network architecture, RENASNet. This architecture achieves a competitive result on CIFAR-10. The explored network architecture is transferable to ImageNet and achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy, i.e., 75.7\% top-1 accuracy with 5.36M parameters on mobile ImageNet. We further test its performance on semantic segmentation with DeepLabv3 on the PASCAL VOC. RENASNet outperforms MobileNet-v1, MobileNet-v2 and NASNet.

We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding.

	abstract = {Traditional neural architecture search (NAS) has a significant impact in computer vision by automatically designing network architectures for various tasks. In this paper, binarized neural architecture search (BNAS), with a search space of binarized convolutions, is introduced to produce extremely compressed models to reduce huge computational cost on embedded devices for edge computing. The BNAS calculation is more challenging than NAS due to the learning inefficiency caused by optimization requirements and the huge architecture space, and the performance loss when handling the wild data in various computing applications. To address these issues, we introduce operation space reduction and channel sampling into BNAS to significantly reduce the cost of searching. This is accomplished through a performance-based strategy that is robust to wild data, which is further used to abandon less potential operations. Furthermore, we introduce the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to solve 1-bit BNAS. Two optimization methods for binarized neural networks are used to validate the effectiveness of our BNAS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BNAS achieves a comparable performance to NAS on both CIFAR and ImageNet databases. An accuracy of \$96.53{\textbackslash}\%\$ vs. \$97.22{\textbackslash}\%\$ is achieved on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but with a significantly compressed model, and a \$40{\textbackslash}\%\$ faster search than the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS. On the wild face recognition task, our binarized models achieve a performance similar to their corresponding full-precision models.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has made major breakthroughs and progress in many fields. This is due to the powerful automatic representation capabilities of deep learning. It has been proved that the design of the network architecture is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. In order to obtain a good feature representation of data, the researchers designed various complex network architectures. However, the design of the network architecture relies heavily on the researchers' prior knowledge and experience. Therefore, a natural idea is to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the architecture of the network. Thus going further to the strong intelligence. In recent years, a large number of related algorithms for {\textbackslash}textit\{Neural Architecture Search\} (NAS) have emerged. They have made various improvements to the NAS algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. In order to reduce the difficulty for beginners to conduct NAS-related research, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys began to classify existing work mainly from the basic components of NAS: search space, search strategy and evaluation strategy. This classification method is more intuitive, but it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work in the middle. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: starting with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then giving solutions for subsequent related research work. In addition, we conducted a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison and summary of these works. Finally, we give possible future research directions.},

	title = {Low-memory {GEMM}-based convolution algorithms for deep neural networks},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03395},
	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) require very large amounts of computation both for training and for inference when deployed in the field. A common approach to implementing DNNs is to recast the most computationally expensive operations as general matrix multiplication (GEMM). However, as we demonstrate in this paper, there are a great many different ways to express DNN convolution operations using GEMM. Although different approaches all perform the same number of operations, the size of temporary data structures differs significantly. Convolution of an input matrix with dimensions \$C {\textbackslash}times H {\textbackslash}times W\$, requires \$O(K{\textasciicircum}2CHW)\$ additional space using the classical im2col approach. More recently memory-efficient approaches requiring just \$O(KCHW)\$ auxiliary space have been proposed. We present two novel GEMM-based algorithms that require just \$O(MHW)\$ and \$O(KW)\$ additional space respectively, where \$M\$ is the number of channels in the result of the convolution. These algorithms dramatically reduce the space overhead of DNN convolution, making it much more suitable for memory-limited embedded systems. Experimental evaluation shows that our low-memory algorithms are just as fast as the best patch-building approaches despite requiring just a fraction of the amount of additional memory. Our low-memory algorithms have excellent data locality which gives them a further edge over patch-building algorithms when multiple cores are used. As a result, our low memory algorithms often outperform the best patch-building algorithms using multiple threads.},

	abstract = {Modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are usually restricted by their massive computation and high storage. Parameter pruning is a promising approach for CNN compression and acceleration by eliminating redundant model parameters with tolerable performance degradation. Despite its effectiveness, existing regularization-based parameter pruning methods usually drive weights towards zero with large and constant regularization factors, which neglects the fragility of the expressiveness of CNNs, and thus calls for a more gentle regularization scheme so that the networks can adapt during pruning. To achieve this, we propose a novel regularization-based pruning method, named IncReg, to incrementally assign different regularization factors to different weights based on their relative importance. Empirical analysis on CIFAR-10 dataset verifies the merits of IncReg. Further extensive experiments with popular CNNs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that IncReg achieves comparable to even better results compared with state-of-the-arts. Moreover, to resolve the problem that column pruning cannot be directly applied to off-the-shelf deep learning libraries for acceleration, we generalize IncReg from column pruning to spatial pruning, which can equip existing structured pruning methods (such as channel pruning) for further acceleration with ignorable accuracy loss.

In this paper, we propose a structured pruning method which employs a three-step process to reduce the resource consumption of neural networks. First, we train an initial network on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set. Next, we introduce an iterative pruning and fine-tuning algorithm to identify and prune redundant structures, which results in a pruned network with a compact architecture. Finally, we train the pruned network from scratch on both the training set and validation set to obtain the final accuracy on the test set. In the experiments, our pruning method significantly reduces the model size (by 87.2\% on CIFAR-10), saves inference time (53.3\% on CIFAR-10), and achieves better performance as compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.},

Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifierâ AmoebaNet-Aâthat surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-theart 83.9\% top-1 / 96.6\% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.},

	abstract = {Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2\% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8Ã faster than MobileNetV2 with 0.5\% higher accuracy and 2.3Ã faster than NASNet with 1.2\% higher accuracy. Our MnasNet also achieves better mAP quality than MobileNets for COCO object detection. Code is at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet.},

	abstract = {Designing accurate and efficient ConvNets for mobile devices is challenging because the design space is combinatorially large. Due to this, previous neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too resource demanding for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. FBNets (Facebook-Berkeley-Nets), a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. FBNet-B achieves 74.1\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than MobileNetV2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's search cost is 420x smaller than MnasNet's, at only 216 GPU-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5\% to 6.4\% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2. The smallest FBNet achieves 50.2\% accuracy and 2.9 ms latency (345 frames per second) on a Samsung S8. Over a Samsung-optimized FBNet, the iPhone-X-optimized model achieves a 1.4x speedup on an iPhone X. FBNet models are open-sourced at https://github. com/facebookresearch/mobile-vision.},

We add supervision from high-level features of the large networks in training to help the small network better learn object representation. More specifically, we conduct a mimic method for the features sampled from the entire feature map and use a transform layer to map features from the small network onto the same dimension of the large network. In training the small network, we optimize the similarity between features sampled from the same region on the feature maps of both networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on pedestrian and common object detection tasks using VGG, Inception and ResNet. On both Caltech and Pascal VOC, we show that the modified 2.5Ã accelerated Inception network achieves competitive performance as the full Inception Network.

Furthermore, a generalized kernel method based on Taylor series expansion is proposed to better capture the correlation between instances. Empirical experiments and ablation studies on image classification tasks (including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K) and metric learning tasks (including ReID and Face Recognition) show that the proposed CCKD substantially outperforms the original KD and other SOTA KD-based methods.

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in many computer vision tasks, such as object counting. Object counting takes two inputs: an image and an object query and reports the number of occurrences of the queried object. To achieve high accuracy, DNNs require billions of operations, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained, low-power devices. Prior work shows that a significant number of DNN operations are redundant and can be eliminated without affecting the accuracy. To reduce these redundancies, we propose a hierarchical DNN architecture for object counting. This architecture uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose regions-of-interest (RoIs) that may contain the queried objects. A hierarchical classifier then efficiently finds the RoIs that actually contain the queried objects. The hierarchy contains groups of visually similar object categories. Small DNNs at each node of the hierarchy classify between these groups. The RoIs are incrementally processed by the hierarchical classifier. If the object in an RoI is in the same group as the queried object, then the next DNN in the hierarchy processes the RoI further; otherwise, the RoI is discarded. By using a few small DNNs to process each image, this method reduces the memory requirement, inference time, energy consumption, and number of operations with negligible accuracy loss when compared with the existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Embedded devices are generally small, battery-powered computers with limited hardware resources. It is difficult to run deep neural networks (DNNs) on these devices, because DNNs perform millions of operations and consume significant amounts of energy. Prior research has shown that a considerable number of a DNNâs memory accesses and computation are redundant when performing tasks like image classification. To reduce this redundancy and thereby reduce the energy consumption of DNNs, we introduce the Modular Neural Network Tree architecture. Instead of using one large DNN for the classifier, this architecture uses multiple smaller DNNs (called modules) to progressively classify images into groups of categories based on a novel visual similarity metric. Once a group of categories is selected by a module, another module then continues to distinguish among the similar categories within the selected group. This process is repeated over multiple modules until we are left with a single category. The computation needed to distinguish dissimilar groups is avoided, thus reducing redundant operations, memory accesses, and energy. Experimental results using several image datasets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed solution to reduce memory requirements by 50\% to 99\%, inference time by 55\% to 95\%, energy consumption by 52\% to 94\%, and the number of operations by 15\% to 99\% when compared with existing DNN architectures, running on two different embedded systems: Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero.},

In such networks, the multiply-accumulate operation can be replaced with a single shift operation, or two shifts and an add operation. To provide even more design flexibility, the k for each convolutional filter can be optimally chosen instead of being fixed for every filter. In this paper, we formulate the selection of k to be differentiable, and describe model training for determining k-based weights on a per-filter basis. Over 46 FPGA-design experiments involving eight configurations and four data sets reveal that lightweight neural networks with a flexible k value (dubbed FLightNNs) fully utilize the hardware resources on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), our experimental results show that FLightNNs can achieve 2Ã speedup when compared to lightweight NNs with k = 2, with only 0.1\% accuracy degradation. Compared to a 4-bit fixed-point quantization, FLightNNs achieve higher accuracy and up to 2Ã inference speedup, due to their lightweight shift operations.

Recently, rapid growth of modern applications based on deep learning algorithms has further improved research and implementations. Especially, various accelerators for deep CNN have been proposed based on FPGA platform because it has advantages of high performance, reconfigurability, and fast development round, etc. Although current FPGA accelerators have demonstrated better performance over generic processors, the accelerator design space has not been well exploited. One critical problem is that the computation throughput may not well match the memory bandwidth provided an FPGA platform. Consequently, existing approaches cannot achieve best performance due to under-utilization of either logic resource or memory bandwidth. At the same time, the increasing complexity and scalability of deep learning applications aggravate this problem. In order to overcome this problem, we propose an analytical design scheme using the roofline model. For any solution of a CNN design, we quantitatively analyze its computing throughput and required memory bandwidth using various optimization techniques, such as loop tiling and transformation. Then, with the help of rooine model, we can identify the solution with best performance and lowest FPGA resource requirement. As a case study, we implement a CNN accelerator on a VC707 FPGA board and compare it to previous approaches. Our implementation achieves a peak performance of 61.62 GFLOPS under 100MHz working frequency, which outperform previous approaches significantly.},

	abstract = {Modern convolutional neural networks apply the same operations on every pixel in an image. However, not all image regions are equally important. To address this inefficiency, we propose a method to dynamically apply convolutions conditioned on the input image. We introduce a residual block where a small gating branch learns which spatial positions should be evaluated. These discrete gating decisions are trained end-to-end using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, in combination with a sparsity criterion. Our experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, Food-101 and MPII show that our method has better focus on the region of interest and better accuracy than existing methods, at a lower computational complexity. Moreover, we provide an efficient CUDA implementation of our dynamic convolutions using a gather-scatter approach, achieving a significant improvement in inference speed on MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2. On human pose estimation, a task that is inherently spatially sparse, the processing speed is increased by 60\% with no loss in accuracy.},

For many problems such as object detection and semantic segmentation, we are able to obtain a low-cost computation mask, either from a priori problem knowledge, or from a low-resolution segmentation network. We show that such computation masks can be used to reduce computation in the high-resolution main network. Variants of sparse activation CNNs have previously been explored on small-scale tasks and showed no degradation in terms of object classification accuracy, but often measured gains in terms of theoretical FLOPs without realizing a practical speedup when compared to highly optimized dense convolution implementations. In this work, we leverage the sparsity structure of computation masks and propose a novel tiling-based sparse convolution algorithm. We verified the effectiveness of our sparse CNN on LiDAR-based 3D object detection, and we report significant wall-clock speed-ups compared to dense convolution without noticeable loss of accuracy.},

	abstract = {In the blooming era of smart edge devices, surveillance cameras have been deployed in many locations. Surveillance cameras are most useful when they are spaced out to maximize coverage of an area. However, deciding where to place cameras is an NP-hard problem and researchers have proposed heuristic solutions. Existing work does not consider a significant restriction of computer vision: in order to track a moving object, the object must occupy enough pixels. The number of pixels depends on many factors (How far away is the object? What is the camera resolution? What is the focal length?). In this study, we propose a camera placement method that identifies effective camera placement in arbitrary spaces and can account for different camera types as well. Our strategy represents spaces as polygons, then uses a greedy algorithm to partition the polygons and determine the camerasâ locations to provide the desired coverage. Our solution also makes it possible to perform object tracking via overlapping camera placement. Our method is evaluated against complex shapes and real-world museum floor plans, achieving up to 85\% coverage and 25\% overlap.},

	doi = {10.1109/MIPR.2019.00080},
	abstract = {Computer vision relies on labeled datasets for training and evaluation in detecting and recognizing objects. The popular computer vision program, YOLO ("You Only Look Once"), has been shown to accurately detect objects in many major image datasets. However, the images found in those datasets, are independent of one another and cannot be used to test YOLO's consistency at detecting the same object as its environment (e.g. ambient lighting) changes. This paper describes a novel effort to evaluate YOLO's consistency for large-scale applications. It does so by working (a) at large scale and (b) by using consecutive images from a curated network of public video cameras deployed in a variety of real-world situations, including traf?c intersections, national parks, shopping malls, university campuses, etc. We speci?cally examine YOLO's ability to detect objects in different scenarios (e.g., daytime vs. night), leveraging the cameras' ability to rapidly retrieve many successive images for evaluating detection consistency. Using our camera network and advanced computing resources (supercomputers), we analyzedmorethan5millionimagescapturedby140network cameras in 24 hours. Compared with labels marked by humans (considered as "ground truth"), YOLO struggles to consistently detect the same humans and cars as their positions change from one frame to the next; it also struggles to detect objects at night time. Our ?ndings suggest that state-of-the art vision solutions should be trained by data from network camera with contextual information before they can be deployed in applications that demand high consistency on object detection.},

Many of these risks can be partly attributed to the use of a training image dataset that exhibits sampling biases and thus does not accurately reflect the real visual world. Being able to detect potential sampling biases in the visual dataset prior to model development is thus essential for mitigating the fairness and trustworthy concerns in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a three-step crowdsourcing workflow to get humans into the loop for facilitating bias discovery in image datasets. Through two sets of evaluation studies, we find that the proposed workflow can effectively organize the crowd to detect sampling biases in both datasets that are artificially created with designed biases and real-world image datasets that are widely used in computer vision research and system development.},

	abstract = {The accurate identification of species in images submitted by citizen scientists is currently a bottleneck for many data uses. Machine learning tools offer the potential to provide rapid, objective and scalable species identification for the benefit of many aspects of ecological science. Currently, most approaches only make use of image pixel data for classification. However, an experienced naturalist would also use a wide variety of contextual information such as the location and date of recording. Here, we examine the automated identification of ladybird (Coccinellidae) records from the British Isles submitted to the UK Ladybird Survey, a volunteer-led mass participation recording scheme. Each image is associated with metadata; a date, location and recorder ID, which can be cross-referenced with other data sources to determine local weather at the time of recording, habitat types and the experience of the observer. We built multi-input neural network models that synthesize metadata and images to identify records to species level. We show that machine learning models can effectively harness contextual information to improve the interpretation of images. Against an image-only baseline of 48.2\%, we observe a 9.1 percentage-point improvement in top-1 accuracy with a multi-input model compared to only a 3.6\% increase when using an ensemble of image and metadata models. This suggests that contextual data are being used to interpret an image, beyond just providing a prior expectation. We show that our neural network models appear to be utilizing similar pieces of evidence as human naturalists to make identifications. Metadata is a key tool for human naturalists. We show it can also be harnessed by computer vision systems. Contextualization offers considerable extra information, particularly for challenging species, even within small and relatively homogeneous areas such as the British Isles. Although complex relationships between disparate sources of information can be profitably interpreted by simple neural network architectures, there is likely considerable room for further progress. Contextualizing images has the potential to lead to a step change in the accuracy of automated identification tools, with considerable benefits for large-scale verification of submitted records.},

	abstract = {Machine-learning algorithms have shown outstanding image recognition/classification performance for computer vision applications. However, the compute and energy requirement for implementing such classifier models for large-scale problems is quite high. In this paper, we propose feature driven selective classification (FALCON) inspired by the biological visual attention mechanism in the brain to optimize the energy-efficiency of machine-learning classifiers. We use the consensus in the characteristic features (color/texture) across images in a dataset to decompose the original classification problem and construct a tree of classifiers (nodes) with a generic-to-specific transition in the classification hierarchy. The initial nodes of the tree separate the instances based on feature information and selectively enable the latter nodes to perform object specific classification. The proposed methodology allows selective activation of only those branches and nodes of the classification tree that are relevant to the input while keeping the remaining nodes idle. Additionally, we propose a programmable and scalable neuromorphic engine (NeuE) that utilizes arrays of specialized neural computational elements to execute the FALCON-based classifier models for diverse datasets. The structure of FALCON facilitates the reuse of nodes while scaling up from small classification problems to larger ones thus allowing us to construct classifier implementations that are significantly more efficient. We evaluate our approach for a 12-object classification task on the Caltech101 dataset and ten-object task on CIFAR-10 dataset by constructing FALCON models on the NeuE platform in 45-nm technology. Our results demonstrate up to 3.66Ã improvement in energy-efficiency for no loss in output quality, and even higher improvements of up to 5.91Ã with 3.9\% accuracy loss compared to an optimized baseline network. In addition, FALCON shows an improvement in training time of up to 1.96Ã as compared to the traditional classification approach.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a lot of work on pruning filters from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the intention of reducing computations. The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion (say, \$\$l\_1\$\$l1-norm, average percentage of zeros, etc.) and retain only the top-ranked filters. Once the low-scoring filters are pruned away, the remainder of the network is fine-tuned and is shown to give performance comparable to the original unpruned network. In this work, we report experiments which suggest that the comparable performance of the pruned network is not due to the specific criterion chosen, but due to the inherent plasticity of deep neural networks which allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned. Specifically, we show counterintuitive results wherein by randomly pruning 25â50\% filters from deep CNNs we are able to obtain the same performance as obtained by using state-of-the-art pruning methods. We empirically validate our claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. Further, we also evaluate a real-world scenario where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes needs to be tested on only a small set of classes at test time (say, only animals). We create a new benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such class-specific pruning and show that even here a random pruning strategy gives close to state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, unlike existing approaches which mainly focus on the task of image classification, in this work we also report results on object detection and image segmentation. We show that using a simple random pruning strategy, we can achieve significant speedup in object detection (74\% improvement in fps) while retaining the same accuracy as that of the original Faster-RCNN model. Similarly, we show that the performance of a pruned segmentation network is actually very similar to that of the original unpruned SegNet.},

	abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

	abstract = {Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters.

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8Ã deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of dense depth map generation from two successive image frames in a video. We first recover the camera motion from the observable normal flow pattern using our previously proposed apparent flow constraints. Once the camera motion is estimated, sparse depth data can be directly recovered from the flow pattern. We utilize a hierarchical approach to generate an initial dense depth map from the sparse depth data. This depth map is further enhanced through the refinement of the associated optical flow field in a variational framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide high-quality depth maps. We also have a faster computational time than the conventional optical flow approach.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are successful in many computer vision tasks. However, the most accurate DNNs require millions of parameters and operations, making them energy, computation and memory intensive. This impedes the deployment of large DNNs in low-power devices with limited compute resources. Recent research improves DNN models by reducing the memory requirement, energy consumption, and number of operations without significantly decreasing the accuracy. This paper surveys the progress of low-power deep learning and computer vision, specifically in regards to inference, and discusses the methods for compacting and accelerating DNN models. The techniques can be divided into four major categories: (1) parameter quantization and pruning, (2) compressed convolutional filters and matrix factorization, (3) network architecture search, and (4) knowledge distillation. We analyze the accuracy, advantages, disadvantages, and potential solutions to the problems with the techniques in each category. We also discuss new evaluation metrics as a guideline for future research.},

In this paper, we propose a lightweight anchor-free detector, MAOD, to better balance efficiency and accuracy. Our object detector contains three components: an efficient backbone network (MobileDet), a lightweight feature pyramid structure (L-FPN) and an anchor-free per-pixel prediction method. MobileDet and L-FPN provide more accurate and faster multi-scale feature extraction. Our anchor-free per-pixel prediction method achieves efficient classification and location regression tasks. On the benchmark MS-COCO dataset, MAOD achieves 46.1\% AP at the speed of 68 FPS with the input size 512 Ã 512. When the input size is 800 Ã 800, MAOD achieves 47.1\% AP at the speed of 43 FPS. The fast version of MAOD (320 Ã 320 input size) can run at 91 PS with 43.3\% AP. Compared with other state-of-the-art object detectors, our detector has similar accuracy while maintaining extremely fast inference speed. MAOD achieves an optimal efficiency-accuracy tradeoff.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2014.19},
	abstract = {The limitations of current state-of-the-art methods for single-view depth estimation and semantic segmentations are closely tied to the property of perspective geometry, that the perceived size of the objects scales inversely with the distance. In this paper, we show that we can use this property to reduce the learning of a pixel-wise depth classifier to a much simpler classifier predicting only the likelihood of a pixel being at an arbitrarily fixed canonical depth. The likelihoods for any other depths can be obtained by applying the same classifier after appropriate image manipulations. Such transformation of the problem to the canonical depth removes the training data bias towards certain depths and the effect of perspective. The approach can be straight-forwardly generalized to multiple semantic classes, improving both depth estimation and semantic segmentation performance by directly targeting the weaknesses of independent approaches. Conditioning the semantic label on the depth provides a way to align the data to their physical scale, allowing to learn a more discriminative classifier. Conditioning depth on the semantic class helps the classifier to distinguish between ambiguities of the otherwise ill-posed problem. We tested our algorithm on the KITTI road scene dataset and NYU2 indoor dataset and obtained obtained results that significantly outperform current state-of-the-art in both single-view depth and semantic segmentation domain.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the depth of a scene from a single image. This is a challenging task, since a single image on its own does not provide any depth cue. To address this, we exploit the availability of a pool of images for which the depth is known. More specifically, we formulate monocular depth estimation as a discrete-continuous optimization problem, where the continuous variables encode the depth of the superpixels in the input image, and the discrete ones represent relationships between neighboring superpixels. The solution to this discrete-continuous optimization problem is then obtained by performing inference in a graphical model using particle belief propagation. The unary potentials in this graphical model are computed by making use of the images with known depth. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both the indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our experimental evaluation shows that our depth estimates are more accurate than existing methods on standard datasets.},

In this paper, we introduce SUN3D, a large-scale RGB-D video database with camera pose and object labels, capturing the full 3D extent of many places. The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation â hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all available at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu.},

One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred support lead to better object segmentation.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, leading to "lockdown" policies and social distancing. The pandemic has profoundly changed the world. Traditional methods for observing these historical events are difficult because sending reporters to areas with many infected people can put the reporters' lives in danger. New technologies are needed for safely observing responses to these policies. This paper reports using thousands of network cameras deployed worldwide for the purpose of witnessing activities in response to the policies. The network cameras can continuously provide real-time visual data (image and video) without human efforts. Thus, network cameras can be utilized to observe activities without risking the lives of reporters. This paper describes a project that uses network cameras to observe responses to governments' policies during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to April in 2020). The project discovers over 30,000 network cameras deployed in 110 countries. A set of computer tools are created to collect visual data from network cameras continuously during the pandemic. This paper describes the methods to discover network cameras on the Internet, the methods to collect and manage data, and preliminary results of data analysis. This project can be the foundation for observing the possible "second wave" in fall 2020. The data may be used for post-pandemic analysis by sociologists, public health experts, and meteorologists.},

	abstract = {In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have introduced social distancing guidelines as public health interventions to reduce the spread of the disease. However, monitoring the efficacy of these guidelines at a large scale (nationwide or worldwide) is difficult. To make matters worse, traditional observational methods such as in-person reporting is dangerous because observers may risk infection. A better solution is to observe activities through network cameras; this approach is scalable and observers can stay in safe locations. This research team has created methods that can discover thousands of network cameras worldwide, retrieve data from the cameras, analyze the data, and report the sizes of crowds as different countries issued and lifted restrictions (also called ''lockdown''). We discover 11,140 network cameras that provide real-time data and we present the results across 15 countries. We collect data from these cameras beginning April 2020 at approximately 0.5TB per week. After analyzing 10,424,459 images from still image cameras and frames extracted periodically from video, the data reveals that the residents in some countries exhibited more activity (judged by numbers of people and vehicles) after the restrictions were lifted. In other countries, the amounts of activities showed no obvious changes during the restrictions and after the restrictions were lifted. The data further reveals whether people stay ''social distancing'', at least 6 feet apart. This study discerns whether social distancing is being followed in several types of locations and geographical locations worldwide and serve as an early indicator whether another wave of infections is likely to occur soon.},

We present a system to computationally synthesize shallow depth-of-field images with a single mobile camera and a single button press. If the image is of a person, we use a person segmentation network to separate the person and their accessories from the background. If available, we also use dense dual-pixel auto-focus hardware, effectively a 2-sample light field with an approximately 1 millimeter baseline, to compute a dense depth map. These two signals are combined and used to render a defocused image. Our system can process a 5.4 megapixel image in 4 seconds on a mobile phone, is fully automatic, and is robust enough to be used by non-experts. The modular nature of our system allows it to degrade naturally in the absence of a dual-pixel sensor or a human subject.},

	abstract = {Vision-based semantic segmentation in urban scenarios is a key functionality for autonomous driving. Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images, thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for semantic segmentation - in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.},

	abstract = {The ability of a researcher to re-identify (re-ID) an individual animal upon re-encounter is fundamental for addressing a broad range of questions in the study of ecosystem function, community and population dynamics and behavioural ecology. Tagging animals during mark and recapture studies is the most common method for reliable animal re-ID; however, camera traps are a desirable alternative, requiring less labour, much less intrusion and prolonged and continuous monitoring into an environment. Despite these advantages, the analyses of camera traps and video for re-ID by humans are criticized for their biases related to human judgement and inconsistencies between analyses. In this review, we describe a brief history of camera traps for re-ID, present a collection of computer vision feature engineering methodologies previously used for animal re-ID, provide an introduction to the underlying mechanisms of deep learning relevant to animal re-ID, highlight the success of deep learning methods for human re-ID, describe the few ecological studies currently utilizing deep learning for camera trap analyses and our predictions for near future methodologies based on the rapid development of deep learning methods. For decades, ecologists with expertise in computer vision have successfully utilized feature engineering to extract meaningful features from camera trap images to improve the statistical rigor of individual comparisons and remove human bias from their camera trap analyses. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of deep learning systems which have demonstrated the accurate re-ID of humans based on image and video data with near perfect accuracy. Despite this success, ecologists have yet to utilize these approaches for animal re-ID. By utilizing novel deep learning methods for object detection and similarity comparisons, ecologists can extract animals from an image/video data and train deep learning classifiers to re-ID animal individuals beyond the capabilities of a human observer. This methodology will allow ecologists with camera/video trap data to reidentify individuals that exit and re-enter the camera frame. Our expectation is that this is just the beginning of a major trend that could stand to revolutionize the analysis of camera trap data and, ultimately, our approach to animal ecology.},

	abstract = {The use of camera traps is a nonintrusive monitoring method to obtain valuable information about the appearance and behavior of wild animals. However, each study generates thousands of pictures and extracting information remains mostly an expensive, time-consuming manual task. Nevertheless, image recognition and analyzing technologies combined with machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, improve and speed up the analysis process. Therefore, we tested the usability of a pre-trained deep learning model available on the TensorFlow hubâFasterRCNN+InceptionResNet V2 network applied to images of ten different European wild mammal species such as wild boar (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), or red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in color as well as black and white infrared images. We found that the detection rate of the correct region of interest (region of the animal) was 94\%. The classification accuracy was 71\% for the correct speciesâ name as mammals and 93\% for the correct species or higher taxonomic ranks such as âcarnivoreâ as order. In 7\% of cases, the classification was incorrect as the wrong speciesâ name was classified. In this technical note, we have shown the potential of an existing and pre-trained image classification model for wildlife animal detection, classification, and analysis. A specific training of the model on European wild mammal species could further increase the detection and classification accuracy of the models. Analysis of camera trap images could thus become considerably faster, less expensive, and more efficient.},

A key feature of recent methane mitigation policies is the use of periodic leak detection surveys, typically done with optical gas imaging (OGI) technologies. The most common OGI technology is an infrared camera. In this work, we experimentally develop detection probability curves for OGI-based methane leak detection under different environmental and imaging conditions. Controlled single blind leak detection tests show that the median detection limit (50\% detection likelihood) for FLIR-camera based OGI technology is about 20 g CH4/h at an imaging distance of 6 m, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported estimates of 1.4 g CH4/h. Furthermore, we show that median and 90\% detection likelihood limit follows a power-law relationship with imaging distance. Finally, we demonstrate that real-world marginal effectiveness of methane mitigation through periodic surveys approaches zero as leak detection sensitivity improves. For example, a median detection limit of 100 g CH4/h is sufficient to detect the maximum amount of leakage that is possible through periodic surveys. Policy makers should take note of these limits while designing equivalence metrics for next-generation leak detection technologies that can trade sensitivity for cost without affecting mitigation priorities.},

	abstract = {Vehicle counting plays a significant role in vehicle behavior analysis and traffic incident detection for established video surveillance systems on expressway. Since the existing sensor method and the traditional image processing method have the problems of difficulty in installation, high cost, and low precision, a novel vehicle counting method is proposed, which realizes efficient counting based on multivehicle detection and multivehicle tracking. For multivehicle detection tasks, a construction of the new expressway dataset consists of a large number of sample images with a high resolution (1920âÃâ1080) captured from real-world expressway scenes (including the diversity climatic conditions and visual angles) by Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, in which vehicle categories and annotation rules are defined. Moreover, a correlation-matched algorithm for multivehicle tracking is proposed, which solves the problem of occlusion and vehicle scale change in the tracking process. Due to the discontinuity and unsmooth of the trajectories that occurred during the tracking process, we designed a trajectory optimization algorithm based on least square method. Finally, a new vehicle counting method is designed based on the tracking results, in which the driving direction information of the vehicle is added in the counting process. The experimental results show that the proposed counting method in this research can achieve more than 93\% accuracy and an average speed of 25 frames per second in expressway video sequence.},

	abstract = {Traffic surveillance systems are interesting to many researchers to improve the traffic control and reduce the risk caused by accidents. In this area, many published works are only concerned about vehicle detection in normal conditions. The camera may vibrate due to wind or bridge movement. Detection and tracking of vehicles are a very difficult task when we have bad weather conditions in winter (snowy, rainy, windy, etc.) or dusty weather in arid and semiarid regions or at night, among others. In this paper, we proposed a method to track and count vehicles in dusty weather with a vibrating camera. For this purpose, we used a background subtraction based strategy mixed with extra processing to segment vehicles. In this paper, the extra processing included the analysis of the headlight size, location, and area. In our work, tracking was done between consecutive frames via a particle filter to detect the vehicle and pair the headlights using the connected component analysis. So, vehicle counting was performed based on the pairing result. Our proposed method was tested on several video surveillance records in different conditions such as in dusty or foggy weather, with a vibrating camera, and on roads with medium-level traffic volumes. The results showed that the proposed method performed better than other previously published methods, including the Kalman filter or Gaussian model, in different traffic conditions.},

	abstract = {Deep learning methods for computer vision tasks show promise for automating the data analysis of camera trap images. Ecological camera traps are a common approach for monitoring an ecosystem's animal population, as they provide continual insight into an environment without being intrusive. However, the analysis of camera trap images is expensive, labour intensive, and time consuming. Recent advances in the field of deep learning for object detection show promise towards automating the analysis of camera trap images. Here, we demonstrate their capabilities by training and comparing two deep learning object detection classifiers, Faster R-CNN and YOLO v2.0, to identify, quantify, and localize animal species within camera trap images using the Reconyx Camera Trap and the self-labeled Gold Standard Snapshot Serengeti data sets. When trained on large labeled datasets, object recognition methods have shown success. We demonstrate their use, in the context of realistically sized ecological data sets, by testing if object detection methods are applicable for ecological research scenarios when utilizing transfer learning. Faster R-CNN outperformed YOLO v2.0 with average accuracies of 93.0\% and 76.7\% on the two data sets, respectively. Our findings show promising steps towards the automation of the labourious task of labeling camera trap images, which can be used to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of ecosystems across the planet.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of âthickâ facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

	title = {Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image transformations?},
	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly assumed to be invariant to small image transformations: either because of the convolutional architecture or because they were trained using data augmentation. Recently, several authors have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains unsolved.},

	volume = {127},
	abstract = {Despite the importance of image representations such as histograms of oriented gradients and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our theoretical understanding of them remains limited. Aiming at filling this gap, we investigate three key mathematical properties of representations: equivariance, invariance, and equivalence. Equivariance studies how transformations of the input image are encoded by the representation, invariance being a special case where a transformation has no effect. Equivalence studies whether two representations, for example two different parametrisations of a CNN, capture the same visual information or not. A number of methods to establish these properties empirically are proposed, including introducing transformation and stitching layers in CNNs. These methods are then applied to popular representations to reveal insightful aspects of their structure, including clarifying at which layers in a CNN certain geometric invariances are achieved. While the focus of the paper is theoretical, direct applications to structured-output regression are demonstrated too.},

	abstract = {Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06766},
	abstract = {A deep learning approach to blind denoising of images without complete knowledge of the noise statistics is considered. We propose DN-ResNet, which is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of several residual blocks (ResBlocks). With cascade training, DN-ResNet is more accurate and more computationally efficient than the state of art denoising networks. An edge-aware loss function is further utilized in training DN-ResNet, so that the denoising results have better perceptive quality compared to conventional loss function. Next, we introduce the depthwise separable DN-ResNet (DS-DN-ResNet) utilizing the proposed Depthwise Seperable ResBlock (DS-ResBlock) instead of standard ResBlock, which has much less computational cost. DS-DN-ResNet is incrementally evolved by replacing the ResBlocks in DN-ResNet by DS-ResBlocks stage by stage. As a result, high accuracy and good computational efficiency are achieved concurrently. Whereas previous state of art deep learning methods focused on denoising either Gaussian or Poisson corrupted images, we consider denoising images having the more practical Poisson with additive Gaussian noise as well. The results show that DN-ResNets are more efficient, robust, and perform better denoising than current state of art deep learning methods, as well as the popular variants of the BM3D algorithm, in cases of blind and non-blind denoising of images corrupted with Poisson, Gaussian or Poisson-Gaussian noise. Our network also works well for other image enhancement task such as compressed image restoration.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of surveillance cameras has greatly improved the physical security of many security-critical properties including buildings, stores, and homes. However, recent surveillance camera looping attacks demonstrate new security threats --- adversaries can replay a seemingly benign video feed of a place of interest while trespassing or stealing valuables without getting caught. Unfortunately, such attacks are extremely difficult to detect in real-time due to cost and implementation constraints. In this paper, we propose SurFi to detect these attacks in real-time by utilizing commonly available Wi-Fi signals. In particular, we leverage that channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi signals also perceives human activities in the place of interest in addition to surveillance cameras. SurFi processes and correlates the live video feeds and the Wi-Fi CSI signals to detect any mismatches that would identify the presence of the surveillance camera looping attacks. SurFi does not require the deployment of additional infrastructure because Wi-Fi transceivers are easily found in the urban indoor environment. We design and implement the SurFi system and evaluate its effectiveness in detecting surveillance camera looping attacks. Our evaluation demonstrates that SurFi effectively identifies attacks with up to an attack detection accuracy of 98.8\% and 0.1\% false positive rate.},

In this paper, we present an unsupervised method to improve the classification result by going deep and combining multistage classifiers in a committee with a small amount of features at each layer. The network is trained layer-wise via denoise autoencoder (dA) with L-BFGS to optimize convolutional kernels and no backpropagation is used. In addition, we regularize the dA encouraging representations to fit sparse for each coding layer. We apply it on the STL-10 dataset which has very few training examples and a large amount of unlabeled data. Experimental results show that our method presents higher performance than the existing ones on the condition via individual network.},

	abstract = {Recent research has revealed that the output of deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input vector. In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97\% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04\% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03\% and 22.91\% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even in a black-box scenario. However, most of the existing black-box attack algorithms need to make a huge amount of queries to perform attacks, which is not practical in the real world. We note one of the main reasons for the massive queries is that the adversarial example is required to be visually similar to the original image, but in many cases, how adversarial examples look like does not matter much. It inspires us to introduce a new attack called input-free attack, under which an adversary can choose an arbitrary image to start with and is allowed to add perceptible perturbations on it. Following this approach, we propose two techniques to significantly reduce the query complexity. First, we initialize an adversarial example with a gray color image on which every pixel has roughly the same importance for the target model. Then we shrink the dimension of the attack space by perturbing a small region and tiling it to cover the input image. To make our algorithm more effective, we stabilize a projected gradient ascent algorithm with momentum, and also propose a heuristic approach for region size selection.

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995347},
	abstract = {Datasets are an integral part of contemporary object recognition research. They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm evaluation protocols. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion in the community regarding this very important, but largely neglected issue.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an important yet less explored aspect in video detection and tracking -- stability. Surprisingly, there is no prior work that tried to study it. As a result, we start our work by proposing a novel evaluation metric for video detection which considers both stability and accuracy. For accuracy, we extend the existing accuracy metric mean Average Precision (mAP). For stability, we decompose it into three terms: fragment error, center position error, scale and ratio error. Each error represents one aspect of stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the stability metric has low correlation with accuracy metric. Thus, it indeed captures a different perspective of quality. Lastly, based on this metric, we evaluate several existing methods for video detection and show how they affect accuracy and stability. We believe our work can provide guidance and solid baselines for future researches in the related areas.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

	abstract = {In the recent past, the computer vision community has developed centralized benchmarks for the performance evaluation of a variety of tasks, including generic object and pedestrian detection, 3D reconstruction, optical flow, single-object short-term tracking, and stereo estimation. Despite potential pitfalls of such benchmarks, they have proved to be extremely helpful to advance the state of the art in the respective area. Interestingly, there has been rather limited work on the standardization of quantitative benchmarks for multiple target tracking. One of the few exceptions is the well-known PETS dataset, targeted primarily at surveillance applications. Despite being widely used, it is often applied inconsistently, for example involving using different subsets of the available data, different ways of training the models, or differing evaluation scripts. This paper describes our work toward a novel multiple object tracking benchmark aimed to address such issues. We discuss the challenges of creating such a framework, collecting existing and new data, gathering state-of-the-art methods to be tested on the datasets, and finally creating a unified evaluation system. With MOTChallenge we aim to pave the way toward a unified evaluation framework for a more meaningful quantification of multi-target tracking.},

	abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300Ã300300Ã300300 {\textbackslash}times 300 input, SSD achieves 74.3 \% mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512Ã512512Ã512512 {\textbackslash}times 512 input, SSD achieves 76.9 \% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

Deep neural networks excel at this task, as they can be trained end-to-end to accurately classify multiple object categories in an image at pixel level. However, a good tradeoff between high quality and computational resources is yet not present in the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches, limiting their application in real vehicles. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture that is able to run in real time while providing accurate semantic segmentation. The core of our architecture is a novel layer that uses residual connections and factorized convolutions in order to remain efficient while retaining remarkable accuracy. Our approach is able to run at over 83 FPS in a single Titan X, and 7 FPS in a Jetson TX1 (embedded device). A comprehensive set of experiments on the publicly available Cityscapes data set demonstrates that our system achieves an accuracy that is similar to the state of the art, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute than other architectures that achieve top precision. The resulting tradeoff makes our model an ideal approach for scene understanding in IV applications. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Eromera/erfnet.},

	abstract = {Active research on computer vision accelerates the progress in autonomous driving. Following this trend, we aim to leverage the recently emerged methods for Intelligent Vehicles (IV), and transfer them to develop navigation assistive technologies for the Visually Impaired (VI). This topic grows notoriously challenging as it requires to detect a variety of scenes towards higher level of assistance. Computer vision based techniques with monocular detectors or depth sensors sprung up within years of research. These separate approaches achieved remarkable results with relatively low processing time, and improved the mobility of visually impaired people to a large extent. However, running all detectors jointly increases the latency and burdens the computational resources. In this paper, we put forward to seize pixel-wise semantic segmentation to cover the perception needs of navigational assistance in a unified way. This is critical not only for the terrain awareness regarding traversable areas, sidewalks, stairs and water hazards, but also for the avoidance of short-range obstacles, fast-approaching pedestrians and vehicles. At the heart of our proposal is a combination of efficient residual factorized network (ERFNet), pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and 3D point cloud based segmentation. This approach proves to be with qualified accuracy and speed for real-world applications by a comprehensive set of experiments on a wearable navigation system.},

	abstract = {Recent work in terrain recognition for outdoor mobile robots mainly focused on several typical pure terrain sample classification, and only one terrain feature is extracted for terrain sample description. In this paper, a segmentation scheme for complex terrain samples is designed for the terrain recognition process. The segmentation scheme is achieved using the graph segmentation followed by the watershed segmentation. The terrain image area is identified on the basis of segmentation. For terrain recognition, several global-based features are extracted from the typical terrain samples: Color Histogram, LBP (Local Binary Pattern), CEDD (Color and Edge Directivity Descriptor), with an ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) classifier to implement the classification experiment. We evaluate the performance of the three features and the principle of extracted feature, and we combined color histogram features with LBP features in series method, and the fused feature are proved to be robust to terrain samples with multi-illumination and jitter scenarios with higher classification accuracy.},

In this context, the detection of ground and obstacles plays a relevant role in giving the first impressions of the external surroundings to a machine. Furthermore, it can guide independent movements and decisions. In this study, we introduce a segmentation method that detects ground and non-ground points of complex scenes under different exposures to illumination, textures, and shading. We prepared a dataset with images collected from some environments in which trees are prominent obstacles. The proposed method uses contrast templates, statistical measures, and morphological operators to reach the ground segmentation. Experiments showed satisfactory results in which trees were well detected and the ground was efficiently segmented with the maintenance of the structure of the image.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require numerous computations and external memory accesses. Frequent accesses to off-chip memory cause slow processing and large power dissipation. For real-time object detection with high throughput and power efficiency, this paper presents a Tera-OPS streaming hardware accelerator implementing a you-only-look-once (YOLO) CNN. The parameters of the YOLO CNN are retrained and quantized with the PASCAL VOC data set using binary weight and flexible low-bit activation. The binary weight enables storing the entire network model in block RAMs of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to reduce off-chip accesses aggressively and, thereby, achieve significant performance enhancement. In the proposed design, all convolutional layers are fully pipelined for enhanced hardware utilization. The input image is delivered to the accelerator line-by-line. Similarly, the output from the previous layer is transmitted to the next layer line-by-line. The intermediate data are fully reused across layers, thereby eliminating external memory accesses. The decreased dynamic random access memory (DRAM) accesses reduce DRAM power consumption. Furthermore, as the convolutional layers are fully parameterized, it is easy to scale up the network. In this streaming design, each convolution layer is mapped to a dedicated hardware block. Therefore, it outperforms the âone-size-fits-allâ designs in both performance and power efficiency. This CNN implemented using VC707 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.877 tera operations per second (TOPS) at 200 MHz with batch processing while consuming 18.29 W of on-chip power, which shows the best power efficiency compared with the previous research. As for object detection accuracy, it achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 64.16\% for the PASCAL VOC 2007 data set that is only 2.63\% lower than the mAP of the same YOLO network with full precision.},

Towards this goal, we label every pixel of PASCAL VOC 2010 detection challenge with a semantic category. We believe this data will provide plenty of challenges to the community, as it contains 520 additional classes for semantic segmentation and object detection. Our analysis shows that nearest neighbor based approaches perform poorly on semantic segmentation of contextual classes, showing the variability of PASCAL imagery. Furthermore, improvements of existing contextual models for detection is rather modest. In order to push forward the performance in this difficult scenario, we propose a novel deformable part-based model, which exploits both local context around each candidate detection as well as global context at the level of the scene. We show that this contextual reasoning significantly helps in detecting objects at all scales.},

	abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i)Â a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii)Â an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008â2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the communityâs progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance.

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, {\textbackslash}eg, allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

	abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed âDeepLabâ system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

	abstract = {Due to the intrinsic complexity of remote sensing images and the lack of prior knowledge, clustering for remote sensing images has always been one of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing image processing. Recently, clustering methods for remote sensing images have often been transformed into multiobjective optimization problems, making them more suitable for complex remote sensing image clustering. However, the performance of the multiobjective clustering methods is often influenced by their optimization capability. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive multiobjective memetic fuzzy clustering algorithm (AFCMOMA) for remote sensing imagery. In AFCMOMA, a multiobjective memetic clustering framework is devised to optimize the two objective functions, i.e., Jm and the Xie-Beni (XB) index. One challenging task for memetic algorithms is how to balance the local and global search capabilities. In AFCMOMA, an adaptive strategy is used, which can adaptively achieve a balance between them, based on the statistical characteristic of the objective function values. In addition, in the multiobjective memetic framework, in order to acquire more individuals with high quality, a new population update strategy is devised, in which the updated population is composed of individuals generated in both the local and global searches. Finally, to evaluate the proposed AFCMOMA algorithm, experiments using three remote sensing images were conducted, which confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In scene classification, effective feature selection can significantly boost the final performance. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-based feature-selection method is proposed, which formulates the feature-selection problem as a feature reconstruction problem. Note that the popular deep-learning technique, i.e., the deep belief network (DBN), achieves feature abstraction by minimizing the reconstruction error over the whole feature set, and features with smaller reconstruction errors would hold more feature intrinsics for image representation. Therefore, the proposed method selects features that are more reconstructible as the discriminative features. Specifically, an iterative algorithm is developed to adapt the DBN to produce the inquired reconstruction weights. In the experiments, 2800 remote sensing scene images of seven categories are collected for performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Typically, a virtual human can swiftly and effortlessly acquire a human demonstration from a PbD. To generate non-preprogrammed motions, a virtual human should possess the abilities to: (i) segment a whole movement into meaning segments; (ii) learn motion primitives for their adaptation in a changing environment; (iii) represent a combination of a motion primitive and its causalities (a motion tuple) by considering reusability; and finally, (iv) swiftly and reasonably select a dependable motion primitive in accordance with current and goal situations.

	abstract = {This paper presents a texture segmentation algorithm inspired by the multi-channel filtering theory for visual information processing in the early stages of human visual system. The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain, and a systematic filter selection scheme is proposed, which is based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of âenergyâ in a window around each pixel. A square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial information in the clustering process is proposed. A relative index is used to estimate the âtrueâ number of texture categories.},

Vision based technologies assisted by the use of cameras cater to a lot of these ADAS systems. These systems enhance the safety of the driver, passenger and pedestrians on the road. In a typical image taken from an on-board camera of a car, it is the road region that occupies most of the pixels. Therefore, an approach for detecting and eliminating road regions from an optical image is proposed which in turn speeds up computations for further object/ROI detection. Our proposed road detection algorithm works in two stages: i) vanishing point detection; and ii) road region identification. Experimental results show that this approach performs better with real-road images of varying texture, colour and shapes.},

We further introduce another descriptor, which is a modified form of the dense Daisy descriptor. Random forests are used for classification on each descriptor. Classification results of SURF and Daisy descriptors are compared with the results from traditional texture descriptors like LBP, LTP and LATP. It is shown that SURF features perform better than other descriptors at higher resolutions. Daisy features, although not better than SURF features, also perform better than the three texture descriptors at high resolution.},

In Experiment 1, we found that high-reputation workers rarely failed ACQs and provided higher-quality data than did low-reputation workers; ACQs improved data quality only for low-reputation workers, and only in some cases. Experiment 2 corroborated these findings and also showed that more productive high-reputation workers produce the highest-quality data. We concluded that sampling high-reputation workers can ensure high-quality data without having to resort to using ACQs, which may lead to selection bias if participants who fail ACQs are excluded post-hoc.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, allow for easy distribution of small tasks to a large number of workers. Unfortunately, since manually verifying the quality of the submitted results is hard, malicious workers often take advantage of the verification difficulty and submit answers of low quality. Currently, most requesters rely on redundancy to identify the correct answers. However, redundancy is not a panacea. Massive redundancy is expensive, increasing significantly the cost of crowdsourced solutions. Therefore, we need techniques that will accurately estimate the quality of the workers, allowing for the rejection and blocking of the low-performing workers and spammers. However, existing techniques cannot separate the true (unrecoverable) error rate from the (recoverable) biases that some workers exhibit. This lack of separation leads to incorrect assessments of a worker's quality. We present algorithms that improve the existing state-of-the-art techniques, enabling the separation of bias and error. Our algorithm generates a scalar score representing the inherent quality of each worker. We illustrate how to incorporate cost-sensitive classification errors in the overall framework and how to seamlessly integrate unsupervised and supervised techniques for inferring the quality of the workers. We present experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithm under a variety of settings.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called âImageNetâ, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

	abstract = {In object recognition (classification), it was known that the human brain processes visual information in semantic space mainly, that is, extracting the semantically meaningful features such as line-segments, boundaries, shape and so on. But by recent information processing techniques, these kinds of features cannot be detected by computers robustly so that in computer vision it's still difficult to process visual information as humans do. Computers have to process visual information in data space formed by the robustly detectable but less meaningful features such as colors, textures etc. Therefore, the processing methodology in computers is quite different from that in human beings. In the talk, we will address the main principle of the image recognition (classification) approach in computer vision, its seedtime, main results and the difficulty faced recently. From digital cameras, there is a huge amount of 2D-image data. In computer object recognition (or classification), the data should be transformed into an object-invariant inner representation. In order to solve the problem, we need two key techniques, i.e., a robust detector and an invariant descriptor. People have attempted to solve the two key techniques for a long time but so far they didn't find any efficient solution. Human visual performances are still superior to that of computer vision greatly in many aspects. So as a future direction, computer vision should learn some things from neuroscience and brain science. We will discuss what computer vision can learn from human vision and how it will be affected by the new interdisciplinary research. We may still face many difficulties in the future.},

To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity.

Typically, the regions are selected beforehand and then an energy function is defined over them. This two step process suffers from the following deficiencies: (i) the regions may not match the boundaries of the scene entities, thereby introducing errors; and (ii) as the regions are obtained without any knowledge of the energy function, they may not be suitable for the task at hand. We address these problems by designing an efficient approach for obtaining the best set of regions in terms of the energy function itself. Each iteration of our algorithm selects regions from a large dictionary by solving an accurate linear programming relaxation via dual decomposition. The dictionary of regions is constructed by merging and intersecting segments obtained from multiple bottom-up over-segmentations. To demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm, we consider the task of scene segmentation and show significant improvements over state of the art methods.},

Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes.

Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background.

Despite the high accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art methods for this task, there is still room for improvement in generalized and unrestricted datasets. In this paper, we advocate a new strategy inspired by the behavior of humans in gender recognition. Instead of dealing with the face image as a sole feature, we rely on the combination of isolated facial components and a contextual feature which we call the foggy face. Then, we use these features to train deep convolutional neural networks followed by an AdaBoost-based score fusion to infer the final gender class. We evaluate our method on four challenging datasets to demonstrate its efficacy in achieving better or on-par accuracy with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we present a new face dataset that intensifies the challenges of occluded faces and illumination changes, which we believe to be a much-needed resource for gender classification research.},

The demographics survey is ongoing (as of November 2017), and the results are available at http://demographics.mturk-tracker.com: we provide an API for researchers to download the survey data. We use techniques from the field of ecology, in particular, the capture-recapture technique, to understand the size and dynamics of the underlying population. We also demonstrate how to model and account for the inherent selection biases in such surveys. Our results indicate that there are more than 100K workers available in AmazonÂ»s crowdsourcing platform, the participation of the workers in the platform follows a heavy-tailed distribution, and at any given time there are more than 2K active workers. We also show that the half-life of a worker on the platform is around 12-18 months and that the rate of arrival of new workers balances the rate of departures, keeping the overall worker population relatively stable. Finally, we demonstrate how we can estimate the biases of different demographics to participate in the survey tasks, and show how to correct such biases. Our methodology is generic and can be applied to any platform where we are interested in understanding the dynamics and demographics of the underlying user population.},

We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.},

Of particular interest in such applications is the ability to recognize locations in the environment, where events occur, and describe the events common to those locations. This is one of the goals of scene understanding. Scene understanding is traditionally addressed from one of two separate points-of-view: the description of the underlying environment or the action taking-place throughout the scene. Each of these facets is required to address the overarching goal but, is insufficient independently to address the problem entirely. These facets are, in fact, dependent and by considering both, a more complete description becomes available. In this paper, we describe a novel, data-driven scene understanding and classification technique that captures and utilizes information about both the environment and activity within a scene.},

This paper presents a novel probabilistic 3D scene model that integrates state-of-the-art multiclass object detection, object tracking and scene labeling together with geometric 3D reasoning. Our model is able to represent complex object interactions such as inter-object occlusion, physical exclusion between objects, and geometric context. Inference in this model allows us to jointly recover the 3D scene context and perform 3D multi-object tracking from a mobile observer, for objects of multiple categories, using only monocular video as input. Contrary to many other approaches, our system performs explicit occlusion reasoning and is therefore capable of tracking objects that are partially occluded for extended periods of time, or objects that have never been observed to their full extent. In addition, we show that a joint scene tracklet model for the evidence collected over multiple frames substantially improves performance. The approach is evaluated for different types of challenging onboard sequences. We first show a substantial improvement to the state of the art in 3D multipeople tracking. Moreover, a similar performance gain is achieved for multiclass 3D tracking of cars and trucks on a challenging dataset.},

A scene is a view of real world environment with multiple objects and surfaces in a meaningful way. Objects are compact and act upon whereas scene are extended in space and act within. The visual information can be given with many features such as Colors, Luminance and contours or in the form of Shapes, Parts and Textures or through semantic context. The goal of scene understanding is to make machines look like humans, to have a complete understanding of visual scenes. Scene understanding is influenced by cognitive vision with an involvement of major areas like computer vision, cognitive engineering and software engineering.

	abstract = {With the recent advancement of multilayer convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep learning has achieved amazing success in many areas, especially in visual content understanding and classification. To improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the computation-demanding CNN, the FPGA-based acceleration emerges as one of the most attractive alternatives. In this paper we design and implement Caffeine, a hardware/software co-designed library to efficiently accelerate the entire CNN on FPGAs. First, we propose a uniformed convolutional matrix-multiplication representation for both computation-intensive convolutional layers and communication-intensive fully connected (FCN) layers. Second, we design Caffeine with the goal to maximize the underlying FPGA computing and bandwidth resource utilization, with a key focus on the bandwidth optimization by the memory access reorganization not studied in prior work. Moreover, we implement Caffeine in the portable high-level synthesis and provide various hardware/software definable parameters for user configurations. Finally, we also integrate Caffeine into the industry-standard software deep learning framework Caffe. We evaluate Caffeine and its integration with Caffe by implementing VGG16 and AlexNet network on multiple FPGA platforms. Caffeine achieves a peak performance of 365 GOPS on Xilinx KU060 FPGA and 636 GOPS on Virtex7 690t FPGA. This is the best published result to our best knowledge. We achieve more than 100Ã speedup on FCN layers over previous FPGA accelerators. An end-to-end evaluation with Caffe integration shows up to 7.3Ã and 43.5Ã performance and energy gains over Caffe on a 12-core Xeon server, and 1.5Ã better energy-efficiency over the GPU implementation on a medium-sized FPGA (KU060).

	abstract = {Smart Camera Networks (SCNs) is nowadays an emerging research field which represents the natural evolution of centralized computer vision applications towards full distributed and pervasive systems. In such a scenario, one of the biggest effort is in the definition of a flexible and reconfigurable SCN node architecture able to remotely support the possibility of updating the application parameters and changing the running computer vision applications at run-time. In this respect, this paper presents a novel SCN node architecture based on a device in which a microcontroller manages all the network functionality as well as the remote configuration, while an FPGA implements all the necessary module of a full computer vision pipeline. In the paper the envisioned architecture is first detailed in general terms, then a real implementation is presented to show the feasibility and the benefits of the proposed solution. Finally, performance evaluation results prove the potential of hardware software codesign in reaching flexibility and reduced latency time.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in smartphones create an ideal platform for robotics and computer vision applications: they are small, powerful, embedded devices with low-power mobile CPUs. However, though the computational power of smartphones has increased substantially in recent years, they are still not capable of performing intense computer vision tasks in real time, at high frame rates and low latency. We present a combination of FPGA and mobile CPU to overcome the computational and latency limitations of mobile CPUs alone. With the FPGA as an additional layer between the image sensor and CPU, the system is capable of accelerating computer vision algorithms to real-time performance. Low latency calculation allows for direct usage within control loops of mobile robots. A stereo camera setup with disparity estimation based on the semi global matching algorithm is implemented as an accelerated example application. The system calculates dense disparity images with 752Ã480 pixels resolution at 60 frames per second. The overall latency of the disparity estimation is less than 2 milliseconds. The system is suitable for any mobile robot application due to its light weight and low power consumption.},

	abstract = {A frame object detection problem consists of two problems: one is a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes, the second is the associated classification of the objects within realtime frame rate. It is widely used in the embedded systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, security, and drones - all of which require high-performance and low-power consumption. This paper implements the YOLO (You only look once) object detector on an FPGA, which is faster and has a higher accuracy. It is based on the convolutional deep neural network (CNN), and it is a dominant part both the performance and the area. However, the object detector based on the CNN consists of a bounding box prediction (regression) and a class estimation (classification). Thus, the conventional all binarized CNN fails to recognize in most cases. In the paper, we propose a lightweight YOLOv2, which consists of the binarized CNN for a feature extraction and the parallel support vector regression (SVR) for both a classification and a localization. To our knowledge, this is the first time binarized CNNÂ»s have been successfully used in object detection. We implement a pipelined based architecture for the lightweight YOLOv2 on the Xilinx Inc. zcu102 board, which has the Xilinx Inc. Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC. The implemented object detector archived 40.81 frames per second (FPS). Compared with the ARM Cortex-A57, it was 177.4 times faster, it dissipated 1.1 times more power, and its performance per power efficiency was 158.9 times better. Also, compared with the nVidia Pascall embedded GPU, it was 27.5 times faster, it dissipated 1.5 times lower power, and its performance per power efficiency was 42.9 times better. Thus, our method is suitable for the frame object detector for an embedded vision system.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have become a practical means to perform vision tasks, particularly in the area of image classification. FPGAs are well known to be able to perform convolutions efficiently, however, most recent efforts to run CNNs on FPGAs have shown limited advantages over other devices such as GPUs. Previous approaches on FPGAs have often been memory bound due to the limited external memory bandwidth on the FPGA device. We show a novel architecture written in OpenCL(TM), which we refer to as a Deep Learning Accelerator (DLA), that maximizes data reuse and minimizes external memory bandwidth. Furthermore, we show how we can use the Winograd transform to significantly boost the performance of the FPGA. As a result, when running our DLA on Intel's Arria 10 device we can achieve a performance of 1020 img/s, or 23 img/s/W when running the AlexNet CNN benchmark. This comes to 1382 GFLOPs and is 10x faster with 8.4x more GFLOPS and 5.8x better efficiency than the state-of-the-art on FPGAs. Additionally, 23 img/s/W is competitive against the best publicly known implementation of AlexNet on nVidia's TitanX GPU.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have recently shown great results in a vast set of image applications. The associated deep learning models are computationally very demanding and, therefore, several hardware solutions have been proposed to accelerate their computation. FPGAs have recently shown very good performances for these kind of applications and so it is considered a promising platform to accelerate the execution of deep learning algorithms. A common operation in these algorithms is multiply-accumulate (MACC) that is used to calculate dot-products. Since many dot products can be calculated in parallel, as long as memory bandwidth is available, it is very important to implement this operation very efficiently to increase the density of MACC units in an FPGA. In this paper, we propose an implementation of parallel MACC units in FPGA for dot-product operations with very high performance/area ratios using a mix of DSP blocks and LUTs. We consider fixed-point representations with 8 bits of size, but the method can be applied to other bit widths. The method allows us to achieve TOPs performances, even for low cost FPGAs.},
